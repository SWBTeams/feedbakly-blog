Feedback is said to be a blessing that keeps on giving. We provide feedback to people so that they can improve and better support others. Feedback comes in various forms; in written languages, in words, or a gesture that offers an evaluation of behavior. Giving and getting feedback will help you develop by reinforcing your current strengths and highlighting your weaknesses.

Critical feedback is an important part of the development process, even though it isn't always pleasant. Feedback must be conveyed in a way that’s effective, thorough, actionable, and dialogue-driven.

A common method people use when providing feedback is the classic feedback sandwich, in which you say something positive, followed by something negative, and then top it off with something positive. When giving feedback, you should avoid tip-toeing and sugar-coating to make the feedback more effective.



But how do you give and receive feedback in an effective and genuine manner?



*   **Begin with a micro-yes**: The micro-yes approach begins with a short question that ensures a 'yes,' such as "Can I talk to you?" This opens up the possibility for a conversation.
*   **Avoid being objective**: Feedback must be specific and backed up by data points, patterns, and genuine observations. Feedback should commend or highlight the process and not the individual. The other party should never feel attacked when you provide feedback.
*   **Give it a sense of logic**: Refer to scenarios or data points that had an impact on you and connect them to the outcome of their actions. This gives the feedback a sense of meaning and logic.
*   **Show willingness to help**: Great feedback concludes with a question. A simple question like "how can I help?" can go a long way. It fosters commitment rather than just compliance, resulting in a dialogue-driven, problem-solving environment.

We've looked at how to give feedback; now let's look at how to receive one.

To receive feedback, you must understand that it is not an attack and be open to opinions with which you may not always agree. Opinions that have the potential to stimulate growth. You are not to be defensive. You simply need to listen and ask clarifying questions.


## Why Is Constant Feedback Important?

Whether you're trying to gauge employee or customer satisfaction, feedback should be a long-term process. Unfortunately, many businesses do not devote enough time to a sound feedback process.

Feedback is especially useful when making important decisions. You can manage customer satisfaction and loyalty, maintain customer retention, and improve your products and services by leveraging customer feedback. Customer experience is critical to a company's survival, especially in today's world where customers rely heavily on online reviews when deciding what product to buy.

You should never stop listening to your customers’ feedback, whether positive or negative, to stay ahead of the competition. Here are a few reasons why customer feedback is essential:


* Customer feedback can aid in the development of new products and services. This increases the usability of the product and opens up new markets.

## How To Get The Best Out Of Feedback?

Making the best out of the feedback you receive requires experience regardless of which form it comes. Another sad truth is that while receiving feedback is good, it can overwhelm you with probably more ideas than you could ever act on. This is why you need to filter through the feedback you receive. Once these are identified, you could:



*   Take a look at the context. Often the nature of feedback could be misinterpreted without looking at things from the client's point of view. This influences your perception negatively.
*   It is important to thank your clients sincerely for their time and effort in providing feedback.
*   Strike a balance between being self-confident and being humble. You need to decide if the feedback should be accepted or rejected based on professional or ethical grounds and not on a personal or emotional level.
*   If the feedback is to be accepted, develop an improvement plan.
*   Visualize the outcome and ask yourself how you can support these newly implemented ideas to create the world’s happiest customers.
